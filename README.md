### LADY DASHBOARD

This is an assistant app for Lady Dashboard, the assistant version of our Dashboard at IITH

## Supported Queries

There is a lot of scope of improvement, but this supports queries like:
 
 - When is the next bus?
 - Next bus to Sangareddy from IITH?
 - Next bus for Lingampally?
 - What is in dinner today?
 - What is the lunch for upper dining hall today?

Many more patterns are supported - depending on how well the Google Assistant can recognize it.

## Reporting problems

If you feel some command is not doing what it is intended to do, but something else, please report it as an issue.
